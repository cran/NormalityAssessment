## Description

The `NormalityAssessment` `R` package includes an interactive Shiny
application, which is run locally on the user’s machine. It enables the
creation of normal quantile-quantile (QQ) plots and histograms for
assessing normality. The methods implemented are based on recent
developments made in graphical inference. In the app, the features in
the ‘Explore Simulated Data’ tab enable the user to run the Rorschach
procedure, and those in the ‘Include Your Data’ tab allow the user to
run the line-up procedure. Details on these two procedures can be found
in the articles included in the References section below.

## Installation

The `NormalityAssessment` package can be installed from either
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank">CRAN</a> or
<a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

#### Installing from CRAN

To install from CRAN, run the following code in `R`:

``` r
install.packages("NormalityAssessment")
```

#### Installing from GitHub

To install the package from GitHub, run the following code in `R`:

``` r
